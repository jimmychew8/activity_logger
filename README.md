# activity_logger
Simple program that logs your daily activities. Wanted to see how I was spending my time I guess. Also, wanted to do a quick project using tKinter. There is a simple patch that lets you plot the activities and how you are spending you time using Plotly. You can see the bar graph on Plotly.

Requirements:

1) Python 2.7
2) Plotly account (https://plot.ly/)
